description: How to install NTT Shadcn Component in your project.
---

import { SHADCN_URL } from '@/lib/constants'
import InstallationCard from '@/components/molecules/installation-card/index.astro'

export const BASE_INSTALLATION_COMMAND = `shadcn add ${SHADCN_URL}/<component>.json`

It doesn't matter what framework or package manager you are using. Installing NTT Shadcn Component is as simple as running the <code>{BASE_INSTALLATION_COMMAND}</code> command and replacing `<component>` with the name of the component you want to install.

The entire install process is handled by the `shadcn` CLI tool and works identically to how you would install any other Shadcn component.

## Example

<InstallationCard registryName='test' />
