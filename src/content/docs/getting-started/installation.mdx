description: How to install NTT Shadcn Component in your project.

import { SITE_URL } from '@/lib/constants'
import CommandLineTabs from '@/components/molecules/command-line-tabs/index.astro'

It doesn't matter what framework or package manager you are using. Installing NTT Shadcn Component is as simple as running the `shadcn add https://shadcn-registry-xi.vercel.app/<component>.json` command and replacing `<component>` with the name of the component you want to install.

The entire install process is handled by the `shadcn` CLI tool and works identically to how you would install any other Shadcn component.

## Example

<CommandLineTabs registryName='test' />
